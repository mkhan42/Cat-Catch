# Cat-Catch

Description
This project is our first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. It's supposed to represent our so far knowledge in html, css, javascript, and DOM manipulation. The project is to program any kind of game, that either has a player 1 and player 2, or a game with obstacles or playing against the computer. My, game, Cat-Catch, is a game that involves the main player, which will be a cat, has to catch all the fish in the board. Obstacles in the game will be falling items from the top of the board that the cat has to avoid. I fthe cat gets hit by the falling items, then the game is over and you lose. Each fish caught will earn you points as well.

To play the game, the user will have to use the right, left, up, and down arrow keys on their computers to navigate across the game board.
